 Predicting unknown observables on ground states

 In this project I will use a quantum algorithm to solve a ML problem related to quantum many body physics.
 Specifically, the task is to learn to predict from data expectation values of unknown
 observables on time evolved quantum states under a known Hamiltonian. Alterna
tively, you can consider the task of learning to predict expectation values on ground
 states of a class of local Hamiltonians. As it will be discussed in the lectures, for
 a special class of Hamiltonians one could show that those tasks exhibit a provable
 learning separation with respect to classical algorithms. In this project, we will
 focus on a class of physically motivated Hamiltonians.
